	  <h3>Looks and Cameras</h3>

	  <p>
		<em>Honor</em> has released their compact bezel less flagship phone the <em>Honor Magic 2</em> in October 2018.
		The phone comes with six cameras it is really interesting to know that it comes with a pretty cool slider for the front cameras.
		The thing I really love notoriously about the smartphone is it‚Äôs looks it comes with awesome gradient finish in Red, Blue and Black.

	  <h3>Performence, Storage and OS</h3>

	  <p>
		Well Honor has packs a lot for performance and battery of the phone.
		The phone is powered by HiSilicon Kirin 980 octa-core processor Well it could be 
		said that Kirin 980 is better than Snapdragon 845 in performance. 
		the phone has 3500mAh non-removable battery which means a good count for a flagship smartphone.
		The phone comes with two variants RAM of 6GB/128GB of storage and RAM of 8GB/256GB of storage.
		The UI of this phone is pretty and nice looking it comes with Magic 2 UI and this UI is powered
		by latest Android 9.0 Pie. As I have mentioned there two cameras with the main camera on the front for 
		3D depth sensing this means that make IR face recognition more saffer and faster. but the phone doesn‚Äôt give any space for rear finger print sensor, therefore, Honor has give an inDisplay finger print sensor.

	  <p>Well away from just external features let‚Äôs talk about</p>

	  <h1>
		How the phone actually works like pros & cons?
	  </h1>
	  <p>
		So first of all I would like to share my opinions about the phone then we will look at what experts says about this phone?
	  </p>
	  <p>
		The design of phone is pretty awesome in real it looks really awesomeüëèüëç. But this also causes some problems like it becomes very slippery cause of it‚Äôs glass finish and Aluminium coating at back but for this problem Gorilla glass is provided on both sides of the phone on rear and back. 
		The sliding mechanism make this phone bezelless but some time it causes some bugs like it open up very slow and some time even get stuck in performing face unlock. The phone comes with a in screen finger print sensor which is a bit slower than the rear one.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		The cool üòé think about the phone is that it looks premium and supports all AI modes the voice assistance of this phone YoYo is very cool sounds same like other but it is multi tasking Smart AI bot.
		The phone supports 40W fast-charging which let‚Äôs you to charge your phone around 80% in just 30 minutes.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Honor has mention this about charging of the phone in their official blog.
	  </p>
	  <blockquote class="intextQuote">
		The lightning-fast 40W Magic Charge (10V/4A Max) technology charges the phone up to 50% battery in 15 minutes,¬†and 85% in 30 minutes
	  </blockquote>

	  <p>91mobiles has marked 9/10 (Excellent) for performance of the phone.</p>
