		Harsh Yadav the only author of this blog is a student his self but at the age of 16 he is able to figure out lot of programming related problems. It sounds a bit stupid but yes, when he was of 15 he created a browser for Android Platform he named it Adora and after that he created another app for Android Platform that was SBI as the name sounds the App was specifically designed and developed for banking purposes of SBI users. He had also acquired knowledge about Front-End Web development.

		He had precisely skilled in Unix, FreeBSD, HTML, XHTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, C/C++, and Python. of course he have acquired no degree but hold on he have completed almost 15+ courses on these topics. But I believe that knowledge is more preferable than degree.
		
		You may thought what a student could teach you ? but hold on buddy there is no age limit to teach and learn. Above from those listed down skills. He also a tech savvy crazy about Smart Phones and New up coming technology. So, if you are looking for techy blog to read than do not forget to subscribe Developer's World.
