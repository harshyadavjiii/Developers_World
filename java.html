      <p>
	  <em>Java is an object oriented programming language</em> discovered by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling">James Gosling</a> at Sun Microsystems(A company which was named for its high end unix workstations) now owned by Oracle. Currently till 
	  01/ 01/2019 it is the most famous programming language in the world reason behind its success is that Java is always be trending since its release in 1995 in starting Java was famous because of its contribution in revolution of INTERNET during 1990s it offers developers to create dynamic AppLets 
	  which was use to be bind up with web pages in those days.  AppLets was fun for developers as they were same like images but unlike images they were used to be dynamic this was possible when JDK(Java Development Kit) was in beta form. when Java released their Micro Eddition many of Games and Applications were created with Java. Later on Java has been signed as one of the official languages for Android Application Development by Google. Why we should learn Java?  What are advantages and disadvantages of learning Java ?  Where Java is being used ?  Which are the famous Applications were created with Java ? How to write programes in Java?  Answer to such questions will be given in this post.

    <h3>Where Java is being used ?</h3>
		<p>
		  Why we should learn Java ? 
		  Learning Java is issential as per the current market trend Java is the most famous programming language in the world reason being it is always the trending language.
		  Java is official language for developing Android Application but it is only in one of its scenario.
		  The following places Java is being used 
		  
			<li> Robotics </li>
			<li> Android Application Development</li>
			<li> Artificial Intelligence Technology</li>
			<li> ATMs</li>
			<li> Electronic Consumer Devices. </li>
			<li> Applets</li>
			<li> Setup Boxes </li>
			<li> Servlets</li>
			<li> Web Applications</li>
			<li> Cloud Computing </li>
		</p>
		  
		  <p>
		  Including these scenarios mentioned above  Java is every where. 
		</p>
	  <p>          </p>
	  <h2>How to create our first Java Programme ?</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's create our first programme with Java. 
		  To do that we first need to declare a class with capital letter of everyword while naming 
		  for example MyFirstProgramme and the file should be save with same class name  in this case MyFirstProgramme.java 
		  extension after that we need to declare main method inside the main method we will start code our programme.  Now ,
		  Suppose if you want display something on the computer screen with Java then the statement use for the following case is System.out. println();
		</p>
	
<p><strong>Code:</strong> </p>	
	  
<pre><code>
public class MyFirstProgramme {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        System.out.println("I am awesome!");
}
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre class="computerGreen"><code>I am awesome!</code></pre>

	  <p>Playing with language is necessary so also try some calculations with Java. </p>
<p><strong>Code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>
... 
   System.out.println(1432*234);
   System.out. println(1400/2);
   System.out.println(100+111);
...
</code></pre>

	  <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre class="computerGreen"><code>
335088
700
211
	
</code></pre>
	  <p>Now the class,  method,  and statement these terms may confuse you ðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜Ÿ Don't worry 
		it is very obvious to having such doubts while new to programming. </p>

	  <p><strong>Statements:</strong> it is the piece of code which does something</p>
	  <p><strong>Method:</strong>  it is the collection of sereveral statements. </p>
	  <p><strong>Class:</strong>  class is defined as collection of sereveral method. </p>
	  
	  <p>I hope you have learn something from this post.
